What is the difference between $*, $@, "$*", and "$@" ?  Hint: try changing the
for loop at the end, and try calling the script with paramaters that include
spaces.

Now that you know about functions, loops, math, variable scope, and some special
parameters that can be used both in functions and in scripts as a whole, let's
try putting some of it together!  Make a function that computes the nth
fibonacci number recursively.  If you haven't done that in a while, there's a
sample Python implementation in this directory that you can model your Bash
script after.
