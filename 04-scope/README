Normally, local variables just do what you want them to, but the local_variables
function demonstrates that they don't always work like you would expect from
other languages.

1.  What does the first line in the function do?
        local num=${num:-0}
    In particular, how does this function work without any explicit parameter
    passing?

2.  What does this line do?
        num=$((num + 1))
    In particular, which copy of "num" does it overwrite?
