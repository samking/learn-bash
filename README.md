We all use Bash, but we're also kind of ashamed of it. We don't treat it like a
real language and don't learn much about it, so we aren't as disciplined as we
should be.

This repo is a coding workshop for people who use the occasional basic shell
script but want to learn more about how to script well and be effective on the
command line.  Because Bash can be less intuitive than other programming
languages, this workshop won't assume much prior knowledge. We'll go through
language constructs like control flow, parameter passing, and scope as well as
standards, style, and testing.

Each directory will have a README telling you what to do or what external
resources to read.  Earlier exercises will also include some example scripts for
you to look through.  Where they're included, please read through everything --
don't just execute the files, or you'll miss the comments.
