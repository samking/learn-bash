We all use Bash, but we're also kind of ashamed of it. We don't treat it like a
real language and don't learn much about it, so we aren't as disciplined as we
should be.

This repo is a coding workshop for people who use the occasional basic shell
script but want to learn more about how to script well and be effective on the
command line.  Because Bash can be less intuitive than other programming
languages, this workshop won't assume much prior knowledge. We'll go through
language constructs like control flow, parameter passing, and scope as well as
standards, style, and testing.

Each directory will have a README telling you what to do or what external
resources to read.  Earlier exercises will also include some example scripts for
you to look through.  Where they're included, please read through everything --
don't just execute the files, or you'll miss the comments.

These exercises are fairly short.  They're intended to be a resource for when
you need them as well as a nudge to walk you through things that you've already
seen.  However, the main goal of this workshop is to take these learnings home
with you.  So, are there any bash scripts at your company that could use some
extra tests or that need linting or a refactor?  Take the opportunity to improve
some of that code!
