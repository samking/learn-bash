Any sufficiently complex code probably needs unit tests.  Ideally, before a file

another language, but that doesn't always happen.

Check out this article for a comparison of a few different Bash testing
frameworks:

(or just check out bats as a good default: https://github.com/sstephenson/bats)

Write a unit test for your fibonacci function using the framework of your
choice.

Is any of the bash code in your company complex enough to merit unit tests?  If
so, try writing some!
