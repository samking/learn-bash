Read each of the files in this directory.  Try executing them, and see if the
result is what you expect.

Bash was designed as a shell rather than as a programming language, so it tends
to be permissive with errors (e.g., a user who mistypes a shell command
shouldn't have their whole shell crash).  That doesn't always make sense for
scripts.

After reading through each of the scripts in this directory, try adding the
following line to the top and then re-running them:

set -euxo pipefail

That will set the defaults so that scripts fail faster.
-e sets it to fail on errors
-u sets it to fail on unset variables
-x sets it to print out every command that is executed.  This is great in some
   cases, but there are also definitely times when you don't want to set -x.
-o pipefail sets it to fail when any command in a pipeline fails
