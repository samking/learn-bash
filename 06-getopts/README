You've seen how to get positional command line arguments using things like $1,
but it would be annoying to make a script that had named arguments using that.

For a few different solutions to command line argument parsing in bash, read

Tweak your fibonacci script so that it takes two named parameters that can be
passed in any order.  One parameter should be n.  The other parameter will tell
the script whether to print all fibonacci numbers <= n or whether to only print
fib(n).

Try implementing this using getopts as well as at least one other style.
