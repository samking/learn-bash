Having a linter can enforce some stylistic constraints and help catch a few
common types of bugs.  For bash, the most common linter is shellcheck:

1.  Try running shellcheck on some of the scripts in these exercises.  What are
    some best practices that the example code violated?

2.  Get shellcheck working in your editor of choice

3.  Get shellcheck integrated as a linter for your company's bash code.  Try
    running some bash scripts through it -- are there any subtle errors that it
    was able to find?
