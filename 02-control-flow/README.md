These files outline a few different Bash basics including control flow and
variables.  There will be links to more documentation where relevant.

Once you have gone through the files in this directory, make a bash script with
a function that prints out the longest filename in a directory that is passed in
as a parameter.

This exercise and the previous exercise are necessary for the basics.  All of
the subsequent exercises are small deep-dives to help you better understand and
deal with specific areas of bash.
